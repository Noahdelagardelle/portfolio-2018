description: 'Future trips to Mars will require long term sustainable ways to create food. The goal of this app is to give crew members a easy to use app for keeping track of plant health and growth. The idea is that plants will be grown on trays in a greenhouse environment, both onboard the ship and on the planet. The trays will have corresponding coordinates that allow crew members to quickly identify a particular plant. Equipment onboard will monitor the health and growth of each plant and push that data to the app for crew members to easily access and understand. ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ±ðŸš€'

    Case scenarios were created to better understand how the app should be set up so that the main tasks can be completed in the most logical and easy to understand way possible.

    Ideations of layout, color palette, and icon implementation was my next step. My thinking was to choose colors that would be easily visible on Marâ€™s brown and red surface. Layouts were developed through many iterations and explorationsâ€”here are a few of them.
