description: 'I’ve always been fascinated by outer space. There is something almost nauseating about considering its vastness. Out of Reach is my exploration of the depths of space by cataloguing objects, both man made and otherwise, that are truly out of man’s reach. The visual design and art direction is highly influenced by NASA’s 1970s brand guides, which possess a sterile aesthetic that interests me. I chose to bind the book using a series of rings that create a faux binder or spiral notebook feel so that the reader is allowed lay the book entirely flat, or hold in one hand neatly to imitate a small journal or scientific booklet that a NASA engineer might use.'

    Along the left margin of the book is a running visual marker that illustrates the growing distance from Earth, the father into the book the farther away the object is.

    The ability to lay the book completely flat and bend the book in half at any page was important to me because I wanted the reader to be able to hold it in one hand. This is an allusion to old scientific notebooks and mathematics reference books used by early NASA. It has the added benefit of allowing you to focus entirely on either the images or information.
