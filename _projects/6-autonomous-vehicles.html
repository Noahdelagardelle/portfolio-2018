description: 'In an age where misinformation is spread as quickly as it is created the designer’s role to present information clearly and truthfully is more important than ever. So, inspired by short and informative ‘explainer videos’ I decided to use a different medium to approach the sharing of information in a clear concise ‘bitesize’ way, in order to introduce someone to a concept. The concept being autonomous vehicles. Why? Because it fascinates me to no end. Autonomous cars is a topic that has its fingers in a lot of different worlds, from AI to ethics, to the automotive industry, there is a lot to be learned. I took my inspiration from Russian Constructivism aesthetics, there was something about that look and ideology that seemed appropriate for a topic involving politics, technology, and everything in between.'
