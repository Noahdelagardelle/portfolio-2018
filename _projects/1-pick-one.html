description: 'Pick One! Is a campaign at UW-Stout to encourage students to get involved in one of the 160 student organizations. The campaign was launched in 2015 with a website to match. Its purpose being for people to go to in order to learn more about Pick One and to explore the different categories of organizations available. I was tasked with giving the site a facelift for 2018. I chose to highlight the posters featured around campus and introduced engaging animations and interactions to encourage interaction.'
