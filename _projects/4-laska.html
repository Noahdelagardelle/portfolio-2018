description: 'I had the great pleasure of crafting a website and logo for LASKA, based out of Eau Claire, WI and Minneapolis. Songwriting sister trio, weave influences of Alternative, Americana and Desert Rock with raw emotion in their songs. I worked closely with the band to create a wordmark logo and website to match that reflected their sound and personality. Do yourself a favor and check out their music while youâ€™re at it!'

            To save the band some time and money I decided to opt out of a CMS and simply use an embedded Google Docs file so they could update their showtimes as needed. The site is hosted using Github Pages.
