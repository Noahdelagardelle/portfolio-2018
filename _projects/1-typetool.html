description: 'As someone who spends a lot of time designing and thinking about the web I wanted a way to play with typography right in the browser without having to set up a development environment. Type Tool is a tool that allows you to manipulate typographyâ€”from font pairings, font sizes, colors, and simple layout, right in the browser. Once youâ€™ve finished playing and have achieved a design you like you can grab the corresponding css that is generated in the background to put into your own project.'

    Once youâ€™ve styled the text to your heart's desire you can click the button on the bottom right side of the screen to get access to the CSS. Then simply copy and paste it into your own projects. In addition to that, there are font pairing suggestions found on the lower white bar. Take em or leave em as you will, I wonâ€™t judge your font pairing choicesâ€¦ or will I  ðŸ‘€
