description: 'Campus Life Today is a daily email newsletter sent to all 10,000+ students at UW-Stout. The newsletter function is to let students know about upcoming activities and events on campus, both for that particular day and upcoming. The newsletter highlights specific campus student organizations and their upcoming activities as well. I was tasked with rethinking and redesigning the newsletter. This project is currently in progress.'

<p class="project__text">
    The first step was to survey students and ask them what they liked about the newsletter and what they did not. What I found is that most students found scannability very important. Many of them are too busy to sit each day and read each listed event.

<p class="project__text">
    My solution was to develop an easily scannable heading system using illustrations. I also created a unique visual aesthetic that could be associated with the newsletter so students could quickly identify it in their inbox.

    My process always begins with a sketchbook, iterating and brainstorming on paper. Once I get to a place I feel comfortable with I turn on a computer 🖥 and continue to iterate iterate iterate.
