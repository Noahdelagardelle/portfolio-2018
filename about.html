                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>Hello, my name is Noah. I am a graphic designer and front-end developer. I spend most of my time designing
                    and thinking about the web. I am interested in creating beautiful things and experiences that are useful
                    for human beings. I am passionate about responsive design, best practices, and web optimization‚Äîbut also pushing the envelope and embrasing new ideas.</p>
                <!-- <p>I consider myself a full-process designer, which basically means I am interested in every part of the design process. I believe in staying curious, constantly learning, asking questions about the way things are done, and always looking for better ways to do things.</p>             -->
                <p>I am will be graduating from The School of Art and Design at UW-Stout in Menomonie WI with a degree in graphic
                    design and an interactive media focus. I am currently open to opportunities beginning in May. If you
                    have one for me or know of where I can find one let me know‚Äîeither way I‚Äôd be down to grab a coffee sometime
                    and chat! ‚úåÔ∏èüèª‚ú®
